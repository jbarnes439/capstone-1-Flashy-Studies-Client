# Flashy-Studies client!
  This contains the code for the front end of the Flashy-Studies app.

## Flashy-Studies App:
  Flashy-studies is an app that allows users to take their flashcards with them! Due to time constraints the app is currently limited to a demonstration of what the end product will look like. A user is able to quiz themselves over a set of flashcards already in the database. As I continue to add to this project, that database of flashcards will continue to grow. In the future a user will also be able to create their own flashcards for study online, as this was the original idea for the app.

### In order to work properly:
  You will need to also pull down the server github page and run your npm install. That code can be found here: https://github.com/jbarnes439/capstone-1-flashy-studies-server.git
