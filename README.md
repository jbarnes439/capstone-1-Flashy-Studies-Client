# Flashy-Studies!
  This contains the code for the front end of the Flashy-Studies app, or you can just check out the [live version](https://flashy-studies.vercel.app/).

## Flashy-Studies App:
  Flashy-studies is an app that allows users to take their flashcards with them! Due to time constraints the app is currently limited to a demonstration of what the end product will look like. A user is able to quiz themself over a set of flashcards already in the database. As I continue to add to this project, that database of flashcards will continue to grow. In the future a user will also be able to create their own flashcards for study online, as this was the original idea for the app.

## Technologies:
  Create-react-app was used to create the front end. The back end utilizes a RESTful API pattern created with Postgresql, express and Node.js.

### In order to work properly if cloning:
  You will need to also pull down the server github page and run your npm install. That code can be found here: https://github.com/jbarnes439/capstone-1-flashy-studies-server.git
